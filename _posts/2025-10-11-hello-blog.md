## 👋 Hello, Blog. Finally,




I’ve been meaning to start this for a while a place to write about the tech I mess with, the things I break, and what I learn (or don’t).
I usually dive into problems either to solve something specific or just to explore, and I document just enough to reach the next step.
I’ve spent a lot of time tinkering, discovering, and creating solutions since the day I got my first computer in 2007. God has blessed me with endless curiosity.
There’s a chance I might never work in IT professionally, and I don’t want my projects to only live in my head. So here I am, starting this blog.
if you’re the kind of person who likes real-world experiments with code or tools half-broken side projects exploring useful tools and alternatives and not too long postsThen maybe you’ll find something useful here.


## 🛠️ What I’ll Probably Write About
Linux, networking, virtualization, native desktop UIs, malware analysis, backend tooling, Golang, CLI tricks, powershell, open-source projects that catch my eye, and the occasional over-engineered automation for something nobody asked for. whatever I find interesting except JavaScript, That’s where I draw the line.
 
if I poke it, break it, or fix it, it might end up here
